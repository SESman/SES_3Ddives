## SES_3Ddives
Southern Elephant Seal (adult females) three-dimensional underwater path

### Plot legend

  * **Black points:** Seal locations in descent and ascent phases.
  * **Blue points:** Seal locations in bottom phases.
  * **Red points:** Prey encounter envents.
  * **Semi-transparent orange ellipsoid:** Main components of the bottom phase path. Direction and length of the ellipsoid axis relate to the eigenvector and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of SES location during the bottom phase.
  * **Grey lines:** Projection of the 3D path on 2D planes
